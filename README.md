<h2> Premier League Coach Impact</h2>
<h4> Project Description </h4>
<p> 
An underrated aspect of sport is the impact of coaches and managers. There has been some studies but most public data doesn't privide any metric on the impact of coaches on a team or an evaluation of their performance.
I used the Soccer Power Index (SPI) of FiveThirtyEight as the metric to assess each team's "strength" and compared their end-of-season SPI with their SPI at the start and used the difference for the X-axis of the graph.
For the Y-axis, I used the difference between their predicted points at the start of the season and their actual points to account for other unaccounted-by-SPI stuff such as luck and the size of the circles representing each team's SPI at the end of the season.

The interesting part of this work was the fact that the standout teams were exactly the team's whose managers were candidates for the manager of the season.
